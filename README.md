CrossSockets:

CrossSockets is a library for C++ to work with the POSIX and Winsock2 sockets.
CrossSockets can help you implement a network communication application.
CrossSockets was created to serve as a client - server communication protocol.

Example: 

If the server is running you can establish a connection using putty or any other client.
(if you use putty you need to connect to the server using a RAW connection)
